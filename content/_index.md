## Miles Y.


Currently an undergraduate student at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs/) interested in computer graphics, computational design, and high preformance computing. I'm currently a student assistant at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/) where I work on optimizing HPC infrastructure. 


Im also a large supporter of privacy protections, anonymity, digital rights, right to repair, open source, anti DRM, etc.


I try and keep my online presence to a minimum for various privacy reasons (AI, webscraping, etc). I don't have much on this site, but feel free to check out some of my [projects](/projects/), [writings](/blog/), and [dotfiles](https://github.com/xihn).
